A browser addon that makes it easier to spot fake news on your facebook. We use a sophisticated artificial intelligence to give you information about articles in your newsfeed and a magical unicorn that marks it with rainbows and poop!

Sparked from our project that won the Global AI Hackathon Amsterdam fake news challenge, created by TheTeamButBetter.
